# Currency Converter ReactJS Setup Guide

Please follow these steps to run your Currency Converter project without any errors:

## Get Your API Key
1. Sign up for an account at [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
2. Navigate to the API key section and generate a new API key.

**Note:** The API is free but has a limited number of requests per day.

## Insert Your API Key
1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Locate the `components/ConverterForm.jsx` file in your project.
3. Find the `API_KEY` variable and replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual API key.

## Save and Test
1. Save the `components/ConverterForm.jsx` file after adding your API key.
2. Open the VS Code terminal by pressing `Ctrl + J` and run the following commands:
    `npm install` This command will install the necessary dependencies.
    `npm run dev` This command will start the local development server.

Click on the `localhost` link that appears in the terminal to open the project in your browser and check its functionality.
